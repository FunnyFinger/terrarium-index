  "description": "Agave filifera, commonly known as Thread Agave, is a small succulent native to Mexico, particularly the states of Hidalgo and Querétaro. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves (20-40 cm in diameter) with white, thread-like filaments along the leaf margins, giving it the common name. The plant displays a compact, rosette-forming growth habit. It produces small, yellow to green flowers on a tall spike, after which the rosette dies (monocarpic). In its native habitat, it grows in well-draining, rocky soils in semi-arid regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique interest with its distinctive thread-like filaments. It's popular among succulent enthusiasts for its compact size and unusual appearance.",
