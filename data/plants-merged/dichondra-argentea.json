  "description": "Dichondra argentea, commonly known as Silver Falls, Silver Ponyfoot, or Silver Dichondra, is a trailing, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae (morning glory) family and features small, round to kidney-shaped, silvery-gray to silver-green leaves (1-2 cm across) that grow on trailing stems. The leaves have a velvety texture and create a cascading, waterfall-like effect when grown in hanging baskets or allowed to trail. The plant displays a prostrate, trailing growth habit and can reach lengths of 90 cm or more. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though flowering is rare in cultivation. In its native habitat, it grows in dry, rocky areas and is drought-tolerant. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds striking silver foliage and cascading texture. It's popular for its unique silver coloration and trailing habit.",
  "careTips": [
    "Drought tolerant once established - allow soil to dry between waterings",
    "Prefers bright light to full sun - silver color is most vibrant in bright conditions",
    "Can handle some drying - avoid overwatering which can cause root rot",
    "Trim regularly to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth",
    "Native to southwestern USA and northern Mexico - prefers moderate temperatures (18-27°C)",
    "Well-draining substrate essential - avoid waterlogged conditions",
    "Moderate humidity (50-60%) is sufficient - does not require high humidity",
    "Feed monthly during growing season with balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Can be grown in hanging baskets, terrariums, or as ground cover",
    "If leaves lose silver color, increase light exposure",
    "Watch for spider mites in dry conditions"
