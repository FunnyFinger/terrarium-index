  "description": "Alocasia scalprum is a tropical aroid native to the Philippines, particularly in tropical forests. It belongs to the Araceae family and features arrow-shaped to lance-shaped, dark green leaves (20-40 cm long) with prominent veins. The leaves have a distinctive shape resembling a scalpel or knife blade, hence the species name. The plant displays an upright, clumping growth habit and typically reaches 60-120 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids. In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, tropical statement with its distinctive leaf shape. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its unique leaf form.",
