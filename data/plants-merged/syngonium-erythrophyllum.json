  "description": "Syngonium erythrophyllum, commonly known as Red Arrow, is an epiphytic aroid native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Panama and Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features climbing or trailing stems (60-300 cm long) with large, dramatic, arrow-shaped to deeply lobed, dark green leaves with distinctive red undersides. The plant displays a climbing/trailing growth habit. Known as \"arrowhead plant\" for its juvenile arrow-shaped leaves that develop into deeply lobed adult leaves. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds dynamic visual interest with leaves that change shape dramatically as the plant matures. It's popular among houseplant enthusiasts for its attractive red-undersided foliage.",
