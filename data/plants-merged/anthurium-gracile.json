  "description": "Anthurium gracile is an epiphytic aroid native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features lance-shaped to oval, dark green leaves (15-30 cm long) with prominent veins. The plant produces small, colorful spathes (modified leaves) in various colors including red, pink, or white, with tiny true flowers clustered on the spadix. The plant displays an upright, compact growth habit and typically reaches 30-60 cm in height. In its native habitat, it grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks and branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds vibrant color with its colorful spathes. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its attractive flowers.",
