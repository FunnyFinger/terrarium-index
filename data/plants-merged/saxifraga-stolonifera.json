  "description": "Saxifraga stolonifera, commonly known as Strawberry Begonia or Creeping Saxifrage, is a versatile perennial native to China, Japan, and Korea. Despite its common names, it is neither a begonia nor a geranium, but a member of the Saxifragaceae family. It features heart-shaped, rounded leaves with distinctive white veins on the upper surface and reddish-purple undersides, creating an attractive two-tone appearance. The leaves are typically 3-8 cm wide and have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant displays a low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and typically reaches 10-30 cm in height and spread when grown indoors. It spreads via red stolons (runners) that produce plantlets at their ends, which root nearby to form new plants, similar to strawberry plants. In its native habitat, it grows in forests, meadows, and on rocks at altitudes of 400 to 4500 meters. The plant produces delicate, airy white flowers on tall stems (up to 45 cm) in late spring to early summer, though it's primarily grown for its attractive foliage. It's an excellent choice for hanging baskets, terrariums, and ground cover due to its spreading habit and compact size. The plant is non-toxic and safe for homes with pets. Variegated cultivars are also available, featuring cream or white margins on the leaves.",
  "careTips": [
    "Provide bright, indirect light - some morning/evening sun is beneficial",
    "Keep soil evenly moist during growing season",
    "Allow top 2-3 inches of soil to dry between waterings",
    "Maintain moderate to high humidity (50-70%)",
    "Use well-draining, organic-rich soil mix",
    "Fertilize monthly during growing season with diluted fertilizer",
    "Remove yellowed leaves and trim excessive runners to maintain shape",
    "Easy to propagate through plantlets on runners",
    "Prefers cooler temperatures (50-75°F / 10-24°C)"
