  "description": "Arisaema filiforme 'Java' is a terrestrial aroid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Java, Indonesia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features large, palmately divided leaves with 5-7 narrow, filiform (thread-like) leaflets (20-40 cm long). The plant produces distinctive, hooded spathes (modified leaves) that resemble a cobra or jack-in-the-pulpit, with a long, thread-like spadix. The plant displays an upright growth habit and typically reaches 30-60 cm in height. In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, tropical statement with its distinctive leaf and flower structure. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its unusual appearance.",
