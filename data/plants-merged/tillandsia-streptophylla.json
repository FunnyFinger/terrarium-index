  "description": "Tillandsia streptophylla, commonly known as Shirley Temple Air Plant, is an epiphytic bromeliad (air plant) native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and features upright rosettes (15-30 cm tall) with medium-sized, dramatic, curled, dark green to gray-green leaves with distinctive dense trichomes (scales) that give it a fuzzy, silvery appearance. The plant displays an upright rosette growth habit with curled leaves. Trichomes not only absorb moisture but also reflect light, giving many species a silvery or fuzzy appearance that helps reduce water loss. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive fuzzy, curled appearance. It's extremely popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique curled leaves.",
