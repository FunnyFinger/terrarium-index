  "description": "Elodea densa (synonym: Egeria densa), commonly known as Brazilian Waterweed, Anacharis, or Dense Waterweed, is a fast-growing aquatic plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, though it has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and features whorled, lanceolate to oblong, bright green leaves (1-3 cm long, 2-4 mm wide) arranged in groups of 3-6 along branching stems. The leaves are slightly serrated along the edges. This plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit and can reach 60-100 cm in length. This aquatic plant can thrive both fully submerged and partially emersed. In its native wetland or aquatic habitat, this plant grows fully or partially submerged in still or slow-moving water, adapting to fluctuating water levels. It produces small, white, three-petaled flowers that float on the water surface. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty, dynamic movement, and excellent water filtration to aquatic environments. It's one of the most popular beginner aquarium plants due to its hardiness and fast growth.",
  "careTips": [
    "Extremely hardy and beginner-friendly - tolerates wide range of conditions",
    "Can be planted in substrate or left floating - both methods work well",
    "Very fast growing - excellent for nutrient export and algae prevention",
    "Easy to propagate by cutting stems - simply cut and replant or let float",
    "Provides excellent oxygenation for aquariums - releases oxygen during photosynthesis",
    "Trim regularly to control growth - can become invasive if not managed",
    "Native to South America (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay) - prefers moderate temperatures (15-28°C)",
    "Low to moderate light is sufficient (1-2 watts per gallon) - very adaptable",
    "Prefers pH 6.5-8.0 and soft to hard water (2-20 dGH) - very forgiving",
    "CO2 supplementation beneficial but not required - grows well without it",
    "Non-toxic and safe for all aquarium inhabitants",
    "Can be used as background or midground plant, or as floating cover",
    "If leaves melt when first introduced, new growth will adapt to tank conditions",
    "Watch for overgrowth - can shade other plants if not trimmed regularly"
