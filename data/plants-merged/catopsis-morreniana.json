  "description": "Catopsis morreniana is an epiphytic bromeliad native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and features upright rosettes (20-40 cm tall) with medium-sized, dramatic, lance-shaped, dark green leaves with distinctive red coloration and central water-holding cups. The plant displays an upright rosette growth habit. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds vibrant colors and visual interest to any environment. It's popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its attractive red foliage.",
