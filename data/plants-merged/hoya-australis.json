  "description": "Hoya australis is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and features trailing or climbing stems (60-300 cm long) with thick, waxy, dark green leaves and clusters of star-shaped, white to cream flowers with pink centers. The flowers have a distinctive star shape with a waxy texture and often emit strong, pleasant fragrances, especially at night. Adapted to tropical climates with high humidity, consistent warmth, and filtered light conditions. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds tropical charm with its waxy, star-shaped flowers and trailing vines. It's popular among Hoya enthusiasts for its easy care and fragrant flowers.",
