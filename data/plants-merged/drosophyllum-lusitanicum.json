  "description": "Drosophyllum lusitanicum, commonly known as Portuguese Sundew or Dewy Pine, is a carnivorous plant native to Portugal, Spain, and Morocco. It belongs to the Drosophyllaceae family and features upright, linear, sticky leaves (20-30 cm long) covered with glandular hairs that trap and digest insects. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. It produces small, yellow flowers in spring. In appearance, it is similar to the related genus Drosera (the sundews), and to the much more distantly related Byblis (the rainbow plants). Unlike most carnivorous plants, it prefers well-draining, alkaline soils. In its native habitat, it grows in nutrient-poor, sandy soils in Mediterranean regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant offers unique intrigue with its sticky trapping mechanism. It's popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unusual habitat preferences.",
