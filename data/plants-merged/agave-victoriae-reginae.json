  "description": "Agave victoriae-reginae, commonly known as Queen Victoria Agave or Royal Agave, is a small succulent native to Mexico, particularly the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Nuevo León. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and features a compact, spherical rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves (15-30 cm in diameter) with distinctive white streaks and markings on sculptured, geometrical leaves, giving it a unique appearance. The plant displays a compact, rosette-forming growth habit. It produces yellow to green flowers on a tall spike, after which the rosette dies (monocarpic). Popular as an ornamental for its attractive white markings. In its native habitat, it grows in well-draining, rocky soils in semi-arid regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique interest with its distinctive spherical form and white markings. It's extremely popular among succulent enthusiasts for its compact size and ornamental appearance.",
