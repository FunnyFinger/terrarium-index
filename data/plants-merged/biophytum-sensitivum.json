  "description": "Biophytum sensitivum, commonly known as Little Tree Plant or Sensitive Plant, is a fascinating small herbaceous plant native to tropical Asia and Africa. It features a palm-like appearance with a single stem topped by a rosette of pinnate leaves that resemble a miniature palm tree. The leaves are highly sensitive and fold down when touched, shaken, or at night (nyctinastic movement), similar to Mimosa pudica but in a more compact form. The plant produces small yellow flowers with pink or purple centers. It's an annual or short-lived perennial that adds unique interest to terrariums with its sensitive leaf movements and palm-like appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with filtered light.",
  "careTips": [
    "Provide bright, indirect light - avoid direct sun",
    "Maintain high humidity (70-85%)",
    "Keep soil consistently moist but well-draining",
    "Temperature: 20-28°C (68-82°F) - warm conditions essential",
    "Organic-rich, well-draining substrate",
    "Leaves fold when touched or at night - this is normal",
    "Can be grown as annual or short-lived perennial",
    "Propagates by seeds",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Fertilize monthly during growing season"
