  "description": "Myrmecodia tuberosa, commonly known as Ant Plant, is an epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and features a distinctive, swollen, tuberous base (caudex) with spines and hollow chambers that provide shelter for ants. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves (15-40 cm long) and produces small, white flowers. The species has a fascinating symbiotic relationship with ant species where ants use the hollow chambers as shelter, defend the plant from herbivorous insects, and provide nutrients to the plant through their waste. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit and typically reaches 15-40 cm in height. In its native habitat, it grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks and branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique interest with its ant-plant symbiosis and distinctive appearance. It's popular among plant enthusiasts for its fascinating ecological relationships.",
  "careTips": [
    "Epiphytic - mount on wood, cork, or tree fern - roots need air circulation",
    "Requires very high humidity (70-90%) - ideal for closed terrariums",
    "Interesting symbiotic relationship - ants are optional but enhance plant health",
    "Slow growing - be patient, growth is steady but not rapid",
    "Native to Southeast Asia - prefers warm, humid conditions (20-28°C)",
    "Bright indirect light is essential - avoid direct sun",
    "Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged - mist regularly",
    "Well-draining epiphytic mix recommended - orchid bark, sphagnum moss",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Can be grown in terrariums with high humidity",
    "Watch for scale insects and mealybugs",
    "The hollow chambers (domatia) are natural and should not be filled"
