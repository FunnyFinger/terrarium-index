  "description": "Echeveria elegans, commonly known as Mexican Snowball, White Mexican Rose, or Pearl Echeveria, is a succulent native to semi-desert regions of Mexico, particularly in rocky, well-draining soils. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and features compact, symmetrical rosettes (5-15 cm across) of fleshy, spoon-shaped, blue-green to silvery-gray leaves with a powdery, waxy coating (farina) that gives them a distinctive appearance. The leaves can develop pink or red edges when exposed to bright light or cool temperatures. The plant displays a rosette-forming growth habit and typically reaches 5-15 cm in height. It produces small, bell-shaped, pink to coral flowers on tall stalks in spring and summer. In its native habitat, it grows in rocky, well-draining soils in semi-arid regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds perfect rosette symmetry with its geometric, sculptural forms. It's extremely popular among succulent enthusiasts for its easy care and beautiful rosettes.",
