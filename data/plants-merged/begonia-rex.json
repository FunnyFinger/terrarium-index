  "description": "Begonia rex, commonly known as Rex Begonia or Painted-Leaf Begonia, is a rhizomatous begonia native to northeastern India, particularly Assam. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and features large, asymmetrical, heart-shaped to oval leaves (15-30 cm long) with striking patterns including spirals, spots, stripes, and iridescent sheens in colors ranging from silver, pink, red, purple, and green. Some varieties have translucent \"windows\" in their leaves. The plant displays an upright, clumping growth habit and typically reaches 15-30 cm in height. It produces small, pink to white flowers, though the foliage is the main attraction. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds vibrant color and visual interest with its spectacularly patterned leaves. It's extremely popular among begonia enthusiasts for its stunning foliage.",
