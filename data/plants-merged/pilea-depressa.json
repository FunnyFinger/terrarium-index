  "description": "Pilea depressa, commonly known as Baby Tears, is a charming houseplant native to the Caribbean. It features a dense mat of tiny, round, bright green leaves with scalloped edges, creating a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant displays a trailing, mat-forming growth habit with vines that can reach 30-60 cm in length, while maintaining a height of only 8-10 cm. The small, glossy leaves are approximately 6 mm wide, giving it a delicate, fine-textured appearance. In its native habitat, it thrives in tropical, humid environments. The plant produces tiny, white, petal-less flowers in clusters during spring and summer, though it's primarily grown for its attractive foliage. It's an excellent choice for hanging baskets, terrariums, or as ground cover in miniature gardens due to its compact size and preference for high humidity. The plant is non-toxic and safe for homes with pets. Regular pruning helps maintain a compact shape and encourages bushier, more dense growth.",
  "careTips": [
    "Provide bright, indirect light - avoid harsh afternoon sun",
    "Maintain high humidity (50-70%) - ideal for terrariums",
    "Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged",
    "Allow top inch of soil to dry between waterings",
    "Prune regularly to maintain compact shape and encourage bushier growth",
    "Fertilize monthly during growing season with diluted fertilizer",
    "Excellent for hanging baskets and terrariums"
