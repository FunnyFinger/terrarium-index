  "description": "Limnobium laevigatum, commonly known as Amazon Frogbit, South American Spongeplant, or Smooth Frogbit, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to Central and South America, particularly the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and features round to heart-shaped, bright green leaves (3-8 cm across) that float on the water surface. The leaves have a spongy texture on the underside that helps them float, and they grow in rosettes. The plant displays a rosette growth habit and forms dense floating mats. It produces long, feathery roots (10-50 cm) that hang freely in the water, providing excellent cover for fish and other aquatic life. It produces small, white, three-petaled flowers that emerge above the water surface. In its native habitat, it grows floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies in tropical regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant provides excellent shade, natural filtration, and a tropical appearance. It's popular in aquariums for its fast growth and ability to provide cover.",
  "careTips": [
    "Floating plant - no substrate needed, roots hang freely in water",
    "Long roots (10-50 cm) provide excellent cover for fish, shrimp, and fry",
    "Fast growing - can quickly cover water surface, trim regularly to control",
    "Provides shade for fish and helps reduce algae by blocking light",
    "Native to Central and South America (Amazon Basin) - prefers warm water (20-28°C)",
    "Moderate to high light recommended (2-3 watts per gallon) for best growth",
    "Prefers pH 6.0-7.5 and soft to moderately hard water (2-12 dGH)",
    "Benefits from regular fertilization - absorbs nutrients through roots from water",
    "CO2 supplementation beneficial but not required",
    "Non-toxic and safe for all aquarium inhabitants",
    "Can be used in aquariums, paludariums, and ripariums",
    "Propagates via stolons (runners) - daughter plants form on stolons",
    "If leaves turn yellow, increase light or add fertilizer",
    "Requires some water movement to prevent stagnant conditions",
    "Leaves have spongy texture on underside that helps them float"
