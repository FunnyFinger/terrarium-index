  "description": "Crassula ovata, commonly known as Jade Plant, Money Plant, or Lucky Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa, particularly the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and features thick, woody stems with glossy, oval to round, jade-green leaves (2-5 cm long) that can develop red edges when exposed to bright light or stress. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant displays an upright, tree-like growth habit and can reach 5-15 cm in height (much larger when mature, up to 1-2 meters). It produces small, star-shaped, white to pink flowers in winter, though flowering is infrequent in cultivation. In its native habitat, it grows in well-draining, rocky soils in semi-arid regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its tree-like form and glossy leaves. It's extremely popular as a houseplant and is considered a symbol of good luck in many cultures.",
