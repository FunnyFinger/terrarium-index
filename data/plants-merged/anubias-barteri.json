  "description": "Anubias barteri is a popular aquatic and semi-aquatic plant native to West Africa. It features thick, leathery, dark green leaves that are arrowhead-shaped and very durable. While primarily known as an aquarium plant, it can be grown emersed (above water) in high-humidity terrarium environments. The plant has a rhizome that should not be buried - it can be attached to wood, rocks, or placed on the substrate surface. When grown emersed, it produces larger, more robust leaves. The plant is extremely hardy and slow-growing, making it an excellent low-maintenance addition to terrariums. It thrives in high humidity and can tolerate various light conditions.",
  "careTips": [
    "Provide low to moderate indirect light",
    "Maintain high humidity (75-90%) for emersed growth",
    "Keep consistently moist - can grow partially submerged",
    "Rhizome should not be buried - attach to wood/rocks or place on surface",
    "Temperature: 22-28°C (72-82°F)",
    "Can grow emersed or submerged",
    "Very slow-growing but extremely hardy",
    "Propagates by dividing rhizome",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Fertilize occasionally with liquid fertilizer",
    "Excellent for low-light terrarium areas"
