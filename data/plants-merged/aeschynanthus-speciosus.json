  "description": "Aeschynanthus speciosus, commonly known as the Basket Plant or Lipstick Plant, is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and features long, trailing stems (60-120 cm long) with large, fleshy, dark green leaves up to 10 cm long and 4 cm wide, arranged in groups along the stems. The plant displays a trailing or climbing growth habit. It produces large, tubular, bright red to orange flowers (up to 10 cm long) that grow in clusters, giving it the common name \"Lipstick Plant\". In its native habitat, it grows as an epiphyte on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds vibrant colors with its bright flowers. It's popular among gesneriad enthusiasts for its large, showy flowers.",
