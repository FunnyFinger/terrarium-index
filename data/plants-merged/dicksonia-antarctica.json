  "description": "Dicksonia antarctica, commonly known as Soft Tree Fern or Tasmanian Tree Fern, is a terrestrial tree fern native to temperate regions of Australia, particularly Tasmania and Victoria. It belongs to the Dicksoniaceae family and features a trunk (up to 300-600 cm tall) with large, dramatic, arching, dark green fronds (up to 300 cm long) forming a crown. The plant displays an upright tree-like growth habit. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of temperate forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant provides lush, feathery texture to any environment. It's popular among fern enthusiasts for its impressive size and attractive appearance.",
