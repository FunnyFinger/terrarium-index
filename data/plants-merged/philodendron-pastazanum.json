  "description": "Philodendron pastazanum (aff.) is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family and features climbing stems (60-300 cm long) with large, dramatic, peltate (shield-shaped), dark green leaves with distinctive venation. The plant displays a climbing growth habit. Many species have velvety leaves with prominent white or silver veins that create stunning contrast, and some produce fragrant blooms. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive peltate foliage. It's popular among Philodendron enthusiasts for its attractive leaf shape.",
