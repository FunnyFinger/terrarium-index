  "description": "Senecio rowleyanus, commonly known as String of Pearls, String of Beads, or Rosary Vine, is a trailing succulent native to southwestern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and features long, trailing stems (30-90 cm or more) covered in small, spherical, pea-like leaves (5-10 mm across) that resemble pearls or beads, hence the common name. The leaves are bright green with a translucent \"window\" that allows light to penetrate. The plant displays a trailing, cascading growth habit and can reach lengths of 30-90 cm or more. It produces small, white, daisy-like flowers with cinnamon-scented centers in late winter to early spring. In its native habitat, it grows in well-draining, rocky soils, often trailing over rocks. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its unique, bead-like leaves and graceful trailing habit. It's extremely popular for hanging baskets and terrariums.",
