  "description": "Alocasia azlanii is a small, terrestrial plant native to Borneo, particularly Sarawak, Malaysia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features upright stems (15-30 cm tall) with small, arrow-shaped to heart-shaped, dark green to purple-green leaves with distinctive venation and a velvety texture. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Many species have distinctive leaf textures - some are velvety, others have metallic or iridescent surfaces that change color with viewing angle. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive velvety foliage. It's popular among Alocasia enthusiasts for its compact size and attractive leaves.",
