  "description": "Phalaenopsis parishii is a miniature epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, Thailand, and India. It's one of the smaller Phalaenopsis species, making it suitable for terrariums. The plant features thick, leathery leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white with purple or pink markings. The flowers are borne on short inflorescences and have a sweet fragrance. This orchid thrives in high humidity and filtered light, making it ideal for closed terrarium environments. It can be mounted on wood or grown in a well-draining orchid mix.",
