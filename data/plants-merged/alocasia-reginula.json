  "description": "Alocasia reginula 'Black Velvet', commonly known as Black Velvet Alocasia or Jewel Alocasia, is a small tropical aroid native to Borneo, Malaysia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features arrow-shaped to heart-shaped, velvety, dark green to almost black leaves (10-20 cm long) with prominent white to silver veins that create stunning contrast. The leaves have a distinctive velvety texture and are held on short, dark petioles. The plant displays an upright, compact growth habit and typically reaches 20-40 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids. In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, dramatic statement with its small, velvety, dark leaves. It's extremely popular among aroid enthusiasts for its compact size and striking dark, velvety appearance.",
