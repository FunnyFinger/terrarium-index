  "description": "Anthurium veitchii, commonly known as King Anthurium, is an epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia, particularly the Antioquia region. It belongs to the Araceae family and features upright stems (60-150 cm tall) with very large, dramatic, pendent, lance-shaped to oblong, dark green leaves with distinctive, corrugated texture and prominent venation. The plant displays an upright, pendent growth habit. Many species have velvety leaves with prominent white or silver veins that create stunning contrast, and some produce fragrant blooms. Native to cloud forests or montane regions, this plant is adapted to cool, humid conditions with constant mist and moderate temperatures. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in cloud forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive large, pendent foliage. It's extremely popular among Anthurium enthusiasts for its impressive size and unique leaf texture.",
