  "description": "Dioscorea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican Yam or Tortoise Plant, is a caudiciform (caudex-forming) plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and features a distinctive, dome-shaped caudex (swollen base) with a thick, woody outer layer up to 90 cm in diameter and 20-25 cm in height. The caudex is divided into regular polygonal plates that become protuberant with age, separated by deep fissures, resembling a tortoise shell, hence one of its common names. The vigorous annual vines, which may reach 9 meters long before dying back in winter, grow from the caudex and bear heart-shaped leaves. The plant displays a climbing growth habit from the caudex. In its native habitat, it grows in well-draining soils in tropical regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique interest with its distinctive caudex form. It's extremely popular among caudiciform plant enthusiasts for its tortoise-shell-like appearance.",
