  "description": "Alocasia lauterbachiana, commonly known as Purple Sword or Lauterbach's Alocasia, is a tropical aroid native to New Guinea and surrounding islands. It belongs to the Araceae family and features long, narrow, sword-shaped, wavy leaves (30-60 cm long) that are dark green with purple undersides and prominent purple veins. The leaves have a distinctive wavy margin and are held on long, purple petioles. The plant displays an upright, clumping growth habit and typically reaches 90-150 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids. In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, tropical statement with its dramatic, sword-shaped leaves. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its distinctive leaf shape and purple coloration.",
