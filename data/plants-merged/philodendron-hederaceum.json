  "description": "Philodendron hederaceum 'Micans', commonly known as Velvet Philodendron, is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Araceae family and features trailing stems (60-300 cm long) with small, dramatic, heart-shaped, dark green to bronze leaves with a distinctive velvety texture and iridescent sheen. The plant displays a trailing growth habit. The name Philodendron means \"tree lover\" in Greek, referring to its epiphytic growth habit. Many species exhibit dramatic color changes as leaves mature, with new growth often showing vibrant red, pink, or orange hues that fade to green. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive velvety foliage. It's extremely popular among Philodendron enthusiasts for its unique texture and iridescent appearance.",
