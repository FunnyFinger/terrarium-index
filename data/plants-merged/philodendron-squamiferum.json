  "description": "Philodendron squamiferum is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly French Guiana and Brazil. It belongs to the Araceae family and features climbing stems (60-300 cm long) with large, dramatic, deeply divided (5-lobed), dark green leaves with distinctive red, hairy petioles. The plant displays a climbing growth habit. The name Philodendron means \"tree lover\" in Greek, referring to its epiphytic growth habit. Many species exhibit dramatic color changes as leaves mature, with new growth often showing vibrant red, pink, or orange hues that fade to green. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive divided foliage and red hairy petioles. It's extremely popular among Philodendron enthusiasts for its unique appearance.",
