  "description": "Selaginella moellendorffii, commonly known as Golden Clubmoss or Moellendorff's Spikemoss, is a vibrant lycophyte native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Taiwan. It features bright lime-green to golden-yellow foliage that creates a dense, carpet-like ground cover. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in a flattened, branching pattern that gives it a fern-like appearance. Unlike true mosses, this is a primitive vascular plant that can survive periods of dryness and revive when rehydrated. It forms dense mats and is excellent for creating lush, prehistoric-looking ground cover in terrariums. The plant thrives in high humidity and filtered light, making it ideal for closed terrarium environments.",
  "careTips": [
    "Requires high humidity (75-90%) - ideal for closed terrariums",
    "Prefers bright indirect light to partial shade",
    "Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged",
    "Well-draining substrate recommended - peat-based mix with perlite",
    "Temperature: 18-24°C (65-75°F)",
    "Can be sensitive to water quality - use filtered or distilled water",
    "Propagates easily by division or stem cuttings",
    "Leaves may curl when dry - increase humidity immediately",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Fertilize monthly during growing season with diluted fertilizer"
