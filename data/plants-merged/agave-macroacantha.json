  "description": "Agave macroacantha is a succulent native to Mexico, particularly the state of Oaxaca. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green to blue-green leaves (30-50 cm in diameter) with sharp, black terminal spines. The plant displays a compact, rosette-forming growth habit. It produces yellow to green flowers on a tall spike (up to 2 m), after which the rosette dies (monocarpic). In its native habitat, it grows in well-draining, rocky soils in semi-arid regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds architectural interest with its distinctive spiny form. It's popular among succulent enthusiasts for its compact size and attractive blue-green coloration.",
