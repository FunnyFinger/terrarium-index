  "description": "Alocasia cucullata, commonly known as Buddha's Hand, Chinese Taro, or Hooded Dwarf Elephant Ear, is a tropical aroid native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features arrow-shaped to heart-shaped, glossy, bright green leaves (20-40 cm long) with prominent veins. The leaves are held on long petioles and have a distinctive hooded or cupped shape. The plant displays an upright, clumping growth habit and typically reaches 60-120 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids (spathe and spadix). In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, tropical statement with its large, dramatic leaves. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its distinctive leaf shape.",
