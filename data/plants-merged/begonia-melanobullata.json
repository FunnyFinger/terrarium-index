  "description": "Begonia melanobullata is a terrestrial plant native to tropical regions of China, particularly Yunnan Province. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and features upright stems (30-60 cm tall) with large, asymmetrical, dark green leaves with distinctive, raised bumps (bullata means \"blistered\" or \"bumpy\") and patterns. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Many begonia species have asymmetrical leaves - a unique trait in the plant world. Leaves often feature striking patterns including spirals, spots, stripes, and iridescent sheens, with some species having translucent \"windows\" in their leaves. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant provides vibrant colors and intricate patterns that add visual interest and texture. It's popular among Begonia enthusiasts for its unique bumpy leaf texture.",
