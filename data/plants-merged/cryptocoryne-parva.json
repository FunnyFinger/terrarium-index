  "description": "Cryptocoryne parva is the smallest species in the Cryptocoryne genus, native to Sri Lanka. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are bright green and form dense rosettes. While it's primarily known as an aquatic plant for aquariums, it can also be grown emersed (above water) in high-humidity terrarium environments. When grown emersed, it forms a dense, grassy foreground that's perfect for terrariums. The plant is very slow-growing but eventually forms a beautiful carpet. It thrives in high humidity and can tolerate both submerged and emersed conditions.",
  "careTips": [
    "Provide moderate to bright indirect light",
    "Maintain very high humidity (80-95%) for emersed growth",
    "Keep substrate consistently moist",
    "Nutrient-rich substrate recommended",
    "Temperature: 22-28°C (72-82°F)",
    "Can grow emersed in high humidity or submerged",
    "Very slow-growing - be patient",
    "Propagates by runners",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Fertilize regularly with root tabs or liquid fertilizer",
    "Excellent for creating grassy foregrounds"
