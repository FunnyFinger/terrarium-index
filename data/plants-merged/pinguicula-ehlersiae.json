  "description": "Pinguicula ehlersiae is a small carnivorous plant native to Mexico, particularly in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Lentibulariaceae family and features a compact rosette of sticky, bright green to red-tinged leaves (3-6 cm long) that secrete mucilage to trap and digest insects. The leaves curl inward when an insect is trapped, increasing contact area for digestion. The plant displays a rosette-forming growth habit and typically reaches 5-10 cm in height. It produces beautiful violet or purple flowers in spring and summer. In its native habitat, it grows in nutrient-poor, wet soils in bogs and high-altitude meadows. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant offers unique intrigue with its rosette form and attractive flowers. It's popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its colorful blooms.",
