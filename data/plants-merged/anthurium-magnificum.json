  "description": "Anthurium magnificum is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features upright stems (60-120 cm tall) with very large, dramatic, heart-shaped to arrow-shaped, velvety, dark green leaves with prominent white or silver veins that create stunning contrast. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Many species have velvety leaves with prominent white or silver veins that create stunning contrast, and some produce fragrant blooms. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive large, velvety foliage. It's extremely popular among Anthurium enthusiasts for its impressive size and attractive venation.",
