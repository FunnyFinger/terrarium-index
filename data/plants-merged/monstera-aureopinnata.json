  "description": "Monstera aureopinnata is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features climbing stems (60-300 cm long) with large, dramatic, pinnately divided (aureopinnata means \"golden-pinnate\"), dark green leaves with distinctive fenestrations. The plant displays a climbing growth habit. The holes in Monstera leaves (fenestrations) allow light to pass through to lower leaves in dense tropical forests. Young leaves emerge solid and develop fenestrations as they mature - the plant \"decides\" where to place holes based on light conditions. In tropical forests, this plant typically grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks, receiving filtered sunlight through the dense canopy. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive pinnately divided foliage. It's popular among Monstera enthusiasts for its unique leaf shape.",
