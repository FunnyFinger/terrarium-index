  "description": "Ardisia japonica, commonly known as Japanese Ardisia or Marlberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Japan, Korea, and China. It features glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are lance-shaped to elliptical. The plant displays a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small white or pink flowers followed by attractive red berries. There are also variegated cultivars available. The plant thrives in high humidity and filtered light, making it suitable for terrarium environments. It's a slow-growing plant that adds structure and interest to terrarium compositions, and the berries add seasonal color.",
