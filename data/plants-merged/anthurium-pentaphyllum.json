  "description": "Anthurium pentaphyllum is an epiphytic aroid native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features palmately divided leaves with 5-7 leaflets (20-40 cm long), giving it a distinctive hand-like appearance. The leaflets are dark green with prominent veins. The plant displays an upright, climbing growth habit and typically reaches 60-120 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids. In its native habitat, it grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks and branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique interest with its palmately divided leaves. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its distinctive leaf structure.",
