  "description": "Aristolochia littoralis, commonly known as Calico Flower, Elegant Dutchman's Pipe, or Coastal Dutchman's Pipe, is a perennial climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly coastal areas. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and features heart-shaped to kidney-shaped, dark green leaves (5-15 cm long). The plant produces distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers (5-10 cm long) that are cream to yellow with purple-brown markings and intricate patterns resembling calico fabric, hence the common name. The scientific name Aristolochia was developed from Ancient Greek aristos (best) + locheia (childbirth), as in ancient times the plant was thought to be effective against infections caused by childbirth. The species name littoralis means 'coastal'. The plant displays a climbing or trailing growth habit and can reach lengths of 2-3 meters. In its native habitat, it grows as a climbing vine in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique interest with its distinctive flowers.",
