  "description": "Tillandsia xerographica, commonly known as Xerographica Air Plant or King of Air Plants, is a large epiphytic bromeliad native to southern Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, particularly in semi-arid to arid regions. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and features large, silvery-gray, wide, curly leaves (20-40 cm long) arranged in a distinctive, sculptural rosette. Trichomes not only absorb moisture but also reflect light, giving the plant its silvery appearance and helping reduce water loss. The plant displays an upright, rosette-forming growth habit and typically reaches 20-40 cm in height. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with red to purple bracts and small, green to purple flowers. In its native habitat, it grows as an epiphyte on tree branches in semi-arid to arid environments, making it more drought-tolerant than most air plants. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a striking, sculptural centerpiece with its large, curly form. It's extremely popular among air plant enthusiasts for its impressive size and drought tolerance.",
