  "description": "Cissus discolor, commonly known as Rex Begonia Vine or Tapestry Vine, is a stunning vining plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Java and Borneo. Despite its common name, it's not a begonia but belongs to the grape family (Vitaceae). It features heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with silver markings and rich burgundy to purple undersides, creating a striking two-tone effect. The leaves have a velvety texture and prominent veining. The plant displays a vigorous trailing or climbing growth habit and can reach several meters in length. It's an excellent choice for terrariums where it can trail or climb, adding dramatic color and texture. The plant thrives in high humidity and filtered light.",
