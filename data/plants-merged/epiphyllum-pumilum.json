  "description": "Epiphyllum pumilum is a small, epiphytic cactus native to Central America. Unlike typical desert cacti, this species grows in tropical forests as an epiphyte on trees. It features flattened, leaf-like stems (cladodes) that are green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces beautiful, large flowers that are typically white or cream-colored and open at night. It's a compact species that's well-suited for terrariums where it can be mounted on wood or grown in a well-draining substrate. The plant thrives in high humidity and filtered light, making it ideal for closed terrarium environments.",
  "careTips": [
    "Provide bright, indirect light - avoid direct sun",
    "Maintain high humidity (70-85%)",
    "Allow substrate to dry slightly between waterings",

    "Temperature: 18-26°C (65-79°F)",
    "Can be mounted on wood or grown in substrate",
    "Flowers typically open at night",
    "Propagates by stem cuttings",
