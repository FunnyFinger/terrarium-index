  "description": "Asplenium bulbiferum, commonly known as Mother Spleenwort or Hen and Chicken Fern, is a terrestrial fern native to New Zealand and Australia. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and features arching, finely divided, bright green fronds (30-60 cm long) that produce small bulbils (plantlets) on the upper surface, which can drop and grow into new plants, hence the common name. The fronds have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant displays an upright, arching growth habit and typically reaches 30-60 cm in height. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a stunning architectural focal point with its elegant fronds and unique bulbil-producing ability. It's popular among fern enthusiasts for its easy propagation via bulbils.",
