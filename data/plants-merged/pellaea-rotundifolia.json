  "description": "Pellaea rotundifolia, commonly known as Button Fern, is a charming, compact evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features distinctive round, dark-green leaflets arranged along arching fronds, creating an elegant, cascading appearance. The plant displays a compact, bushy growth habit and typically reaches 15-30 cm in height and spread when grown indoors. In its native habitat, it thrives in forest understories and rocky areas. The glossy, rounded leaflets give it a unique appearance compared to other ferns, making it a popular choice for terrariums and indoor plant collections. It's well-suited for terrarium environments due to its compact size and preference for high humidity. The plant is non-toxic and pet-friendly, making it safe for homes with pets.",
