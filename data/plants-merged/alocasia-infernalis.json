  "description": "Alocasia infernalis 'Black Magic', commonly known as Black Magic Alocasia, is a small tropical aroid native to Borneo, Malaysia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features arrow-shaped to lance-shaped, dark purple to almost black leaves (15-30 cm long) with a velvety texture and prominent silver to purple veins. The leaves have a distinctive metallic or iridescent appearance that changes color with viewing angle. The plant displays an upright, compact growth habit and typically reaches 30-60 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids. In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, dramatic statement with its dark, velvety leaves. It's extremely popular among aroid enthusiasts for its striking dark coloration.",
