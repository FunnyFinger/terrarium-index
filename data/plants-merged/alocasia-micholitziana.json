  "description": "Alocasia micholitziana 'Frydek', commonly known as Green Velvet Alocasia or Alocasia Frydek, is a tropical aroid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Araceae family and features arrow-shaped to heart-shaped, velvety, dark green leaves (30-60 cm long) with prominent white to silver veins that create stunning contrast. The leaves have a distinctive velvety texture and are held on long, green petioles. The plant displays an upright, clumping growth habit and typically reaches 30-90 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids. In its native habitat, it grows as a terrestrial plant in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, tropical statement with its velvety, veined leaves. It's extremely popular among aroid enthusiasts for its striking velvety texture and white veining.",
