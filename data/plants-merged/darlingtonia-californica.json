  "description": "Darlingtonia californica, commonly known as California Pitcher Plant or Cobra Lily, is a carnivorous plant native to northern California and southern Oregon, USA. It belongs to the Sarraceniaceae family and features upright, tubular, hooded pitchers (30-60 cm tall) that trap and digest insects. The pitchers have a distinctive \"cobra\" appearance with a hooded top and a forked appendage. The plant displays an upright, rosette-forming growth habit. It produces small, yellow to green flowers in spring. In its native habitat, it grows in nutrient-poor, wet soils in bogs and seeps. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant offers unique intrigue with its distinctive pitcher form. It's popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unusual appearance and cold tolerance.",
