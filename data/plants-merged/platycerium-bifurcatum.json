  "description": "Platycerium bifurcatum, commonly known as Staghorn Fern, is an epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Australia and New Guinea. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and features two types of fronds: shield fronds (30-60 cm wide) that anchor to surfaces and fertile fronds (60-120 cm long) that are forked and resemble deer antlers. The plant displays an upright growth habit. Commonly called \"staghorn fern\" for its distinctive forked fronds resembling deer antlers. Produces two types of fronds: shield fronds that anchor to surfaces and fertile fronds that bear spores. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a dramatic prehistoric aesthetic with its antler-like fronds. It's extremely popular among fern enthusiasts for its unique appearance.",
