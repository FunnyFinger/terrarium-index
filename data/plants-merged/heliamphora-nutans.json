  "description": "Heliamphora nutans, commonly known as Sun Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the border area between Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana, particularly on the tepuis (tabletop mountains). It belongs to the Sarraceniaceae family and features upright, tubular pitchers (20-40 cm tall) that trap and digest insects. The plant displays an upright, rosette-forming growth habit. It produces small, white to pink flowers. The trapping mechanism is highly specialized, with some species able to digest prey in just a few hours. Native to nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs, swamps, or sandy soils, where carnivory supplements the limited available nutrients. In its native habitat, it grows in high-altitude, nutrient-poor, wet soils. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant offers unique intrigue with its distinctive pitcher form. It's popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unusual habitat and appearance.",
