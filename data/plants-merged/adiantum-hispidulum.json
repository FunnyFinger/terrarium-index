  "description": "Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as Rosy Maidenhair Fern or Rough Maidenhair Fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pteridaceae family and features finely divided, triangular, bright green to pink-tinged fronds (up to 45 cm long) with distinctive black, wiry stems (stipes). The fronds emerge from creeping rhizomes and have a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant displays an upright, arching growth habit and typically reaches up to 45 cm in height. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant provides lush, feathery texture and is perfect for small spaces. It's popular among fern enthusiasts for its delicate appearance and pink-tinged new growth.",
