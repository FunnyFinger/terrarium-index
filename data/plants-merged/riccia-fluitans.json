  "description": "Riccia fluitans, commonly known as Crystalwort, Floating Crystalwort, or Floating Liverwort, is a free-floating aquatic liverwort (bryophyte) native to slow-moving or still water bodies worldwide, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the Ricciaceae family and features branching, ribbon-like thalli (plant body) that form dense, bright green mats. The thalli are flat, forked, and grow in a Y-shaped branching pattern, creating a moss-like appearance. Unlike true mosses, this is a liverwort - a primitive non-vascular plant. The plant displays a mat-forming, creeping growth habit and can form dense carpets when attached to surfaces or float freely. It has no true roots, stems, or leaves - the entire plant body is a thallus. In its native habitat, it grows floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water or attached to submerged surfaces. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty, excellent water filtration, and provides hiding places for small aquatic life. It's extremely popular in aquascaping for creating moss carpets.",
  "careTips": [
    "Can float freely or be attached to hardscape (rocks, driftwood) or mesh for carpet effect",
    "Attach to mesh or plastic grids for carpet - use thread, fishing line, or mesh to secure",
    "Benefits from CO2 injection (20-30 ppm) for faster, denser growth",
    "Provides excellent hiding places for shrimp, fry, and small fish",
    "Native to worldwide distribution - prefers moderate temperatures (15-28°C)",
    "Moderate to high light recommended (2-3 watts per gallon) for best growth",
    "Prefers pH 6.0-7.5 and soft to moderately hard water (2-12 dGH)",
    "Benefits from regular fertilization - absorbs nutrients directly through thalli",
    "Non-toxic and safe for all aquarium inhabitants",
    "Can be used in aquariums, paludariums, and ripariums",
    "Propagates via fragmentation - simply break off pieces and they will grow",
    "If thalli turn brown, increase light or add CO2",
    "Requires some water movement to prevent debris accumulation",
    "Trimming encourages denser, bushier growth"
