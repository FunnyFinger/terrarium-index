  "description": "Pellionia repens, commonly known as Trailing Watermelon Begonia, Rainbow Vine, or Satin Pellionia, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia) and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its common name suggesting it's a begonia, it is not a begonia but belongs to the Urticaceae (nettle) family, related to Pilea and other nettle family plants. It features narrow, pointed to ovate, asymmetrical leaves (3-6 cm long, 1-2 cm wide) with bright green centers, maroon to brown edges, and distinctive mottled veining. The underside of the leaves is reddish-purple to burgundy, while the top surface has an olive-green to bronze background with deep green veining, creating a striking watermelon-like or mosaic pattern. The leaves have a slightly velvety texture. This trailing or creeping plant grows from a rhizome and spreads via stolons, making it ideal for hanging baskets, terrariums, or as ground cover in tropical gardens. It thrives in high humidity environments and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, though flowering is rare in cultivation.",
  "careTips": [
    "Thrives in high humidity (60-80%) - ideal for terrariums, paludariums, or high-humidity rooms",
    "Can trail or climb with support - perfect for hanging baskets, terrariums, or as ground cover",
    "Easy to propagate from stem cuttings or division - roots readily at nodes",
    "Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged - allow slight drying between waterings",
    "Water when top inch of soil feels dry - use room temperature water",
    "Bright indirect light preferred (avoid direct sun which can fade leaf colors) - can tolerate lower light",
    "Regular pruning encourages bushier, more compact growth and prevents legginess",
    "Feed with balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during growing season (spring-summer) at half strength",
    "Watch for spider mites and mealybugs, especially in low humidity conditions - mist regularly",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "Native to Southeast Asia and Indian subcontinent - prefers warm, humid conditions (18-27°C)",
    "Well-draining, peat-based substrate recommended - can add perlite for better drainage",
    "Leaves may lose their vibrant colors in low light - provide bright indirect light for best coloration",
    "Can be grown as a houseplant in high humidity environments or closed terrariums",
    "If leaves drop, check humidity levels and watering schedule - plant is sensitive to dry conditions"
