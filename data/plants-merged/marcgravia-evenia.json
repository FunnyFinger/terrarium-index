  "description": "Marcgravia evenia is a climbing flowering vine endemic to Cuba. It belongs to the Marcgraviaceae family and exhibits the characteristic shingling growth pattern where juvenile leaves cling flat against surfaces as it climbs. The plant displays a climbing, shingling growth habit and typically reaches 10-40 cm in height when grown in terrariums. It is distinguished by its unique inflorescence structure featuring concave bracts that reflect and focus sonar pulses from bats, aiding these pollinators in locating the flowers more efficiently. This remarkable adaptation enhances pollination frequency by Cuban nectar-feeding bats of the genus Monophyllus. The inflorescence features a ring of tubular flowers rich in nectar, attracting bats that facilitate cross-pollination. The specialized concave bracts are 50% more effective in attracting bats compared to flat leaves. In its native habitat, it grows in tropical forests of Cuba. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds unique visual interest with its shingling habit and fascinating bat-pollination adaptation. It's popular among plant enthusiasts for its unique ecological relationship with bat pollinators.",
