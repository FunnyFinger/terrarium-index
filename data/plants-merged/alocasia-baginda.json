  "description": "Alocasia baginda, commonly known as 'Dragon Scale' or 'Silver Dragon', is a compact jewel Alocasia native to Borneo, particularly Kalimantan, Indonesia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features upright stems (40-90 cm tall indoors) with rounded to heart-shaped, dark green to silver-green leaves (30-40 cm long) with distinctive, scaly, dragon-scale-like texture and venation, giving it the common name. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Many species have distinctive leaf textures - some are velvety, others have metallic or iridescent surfaces that change color with viewing angle. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and may attain greater sizes. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive scaly foliage. It's extremely popular among Alocasia enthusiasts for its unique leaf texture and compact size.",
