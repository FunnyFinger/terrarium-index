  "description": "Dracaena masoniana, commonly known as Whale Fin Snake Plant or Mason's Congo, is a succulent native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and features upright growth (90-150 cm tall, 30-60 cm wide) with large, dramatic, paddle-shaped, dark green leaves mottled with light green spots. The leaves are thick, stiff, and waxy, and can measure up to 90-120 cm long and 20-25 cm wide. The leaf resembles the fin of a whale or shark, hence its common names. Just below the soil surface, there is a distinctive purple-banded sheath. This semi-succulent rhizomatous plant has evolved water-storing adaptations for survival in its native habitat. The plant produces fragrant white flower clusters from the center during summer. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a striking architectural focal point with its distinctive single or few paddle-shaped leaves. It's popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique leaf shape and low-maintenance nature.",
  "careTips": [
    "Very drought tolerant - allow soil to dry completely between waterings",
    "Avoid overwatering - most common cause of problems",
    "Bright indirect light preferred, but tolerant of low light",
    "Avoid temperatures below 13°C",
    "Repot when pot-bound or roots emerge from drainage holes",
    "Can be propagated by division or leaf cuttings",
    "Low maintenance - perfect for beginners"
