  "description": "Microsorum diversifolium, commonly known as Kangaroo Paw Fern, is an epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Australia and New Zealand. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and features trailing fronds (30-60 cm long) with medium-sized, dramatic, leathery, dark green fronds with distinctive shapes. The plant displays a trailing growth habit. Microsorum species have thick, leathery fronds that help retain moisture. This plant has adapted to local climate and growing conditions of its original habitat. In its native habitat, it grows on tree branches in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds exotic fern texture with its leathery, sometimes iridescent fronds. It's popular among fern enthusiasts for its easy care and attractive fronds.",
