  "description": "Lemna minor, commonly known as common duckweed, is one of the smallest flowering plants in the world. It is a free-floating aquatic perennial with small, bright green, oval-shaped fronds measuring 1-8 mm in length. Each frond has a single root (1-2 cm long) that dangles beneath the water surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients. The plant forms dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. Native to most regions of Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, it thrives in nutrient-rich, quiet waters. In aquariums and paludariums, duckweed provides excellent surface cover, helps reduce algae growth by shading the water, and serves as a natural food source for fish and waterfowl. However, its extremely rapid growth requires regular maintenance to prevent complete surface coverage.",
  "careTips": [
    "Very fast growing - can double in size every 2-3 days under optimal conditions",
    "Excellent nutrient export - removes nitrogen and phosphorus from water",
    "Provides shade and cover for fish and aquatic animals",
    "Requires regular thinning to prevent complete surface coverage",
    "Thrives in nutrient-rich water but can grow in various conditions",
    "Can reduce algae growth by limiting light penetration",
    "Produces turions (dormant buds) in cold temperatures that sink and resurface in spring",
    "May require netting or manual removal to control population"

  "additionalInfo": {
    "propagation": "Primarily reproduces vegetatively by division. Each frond can produce daughter fronds that separate and form new plants. Flowers are extremely rare and measure about 1 mm in diameter.",
    "specialNotes": "Used in wastewater treatment and bioremediation due to ability to remove heavy metals and excess nutrients. High protein content (20-40%) makes it valuable as livestock feed. Can be used for biofuel production. In temperate regions, produces starch-filled turions for overwintering when temperatures drop below 6-7°C."
