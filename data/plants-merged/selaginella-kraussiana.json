  "description": "Selaginella kraussiana, commonly known as African Clubmoss, Krauss's Spikemoss, or Trailing Spikemoss, is a primitive vascular plant native to Africa (particularly South Africa and tropical regions) and naturalized in New Zealand, the Azores, and parts of Europe. Despite its common names suggesting it's a moss or fern, it belongs to the Selaginellaceae family and is a lycophyte - an ancient group of vascular plants that predates both ferns and seed plants. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a flattened, branching pattern that creates a fern-like or moss-like appearance. The plant displays a creeping to semi-upright growth habit, forming dense mats or clumps. These are not true ferns but primitive vascular plants called \"spike mosses\" that can survive near-complete desiccation and revive when rehydrated - a process called poikilohydry shared with true mosses and some ferns. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds ancient, prehistoric texture with its primitive fern-like appearance. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures (strobili) at the tips of branches, rather than flowers or seeds.",
  "careTips": [
    "Requires constant high humidity (70-90%) - ideal for closed terrariums or high-humidity environments",
    "Can be sensitive to water quality - use distilled, rainwater, or filtered water to avoid mineral buildup",
    "Propagates by division or stem cuttings - roots readily at nodes",
    "Leaves curl when dry - this is a survival mechanism, rehydrate immediately",
    "Native to Africa and naturalized in New Zealand - prefers warm, humid conditions (18-24°C)",
    "Prefers bright indirect light to low light - avoid direct sunlight which can scorch leaves",
    "Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged - allow slight drying between waterings",
    "Well-draining substrate recommended - peat-based mix with perlite or sphagnum moss",
    "Can be grown as ground cover in terrariums or in hanging baskets",
    "Watch for spider mites and mealybugs in low humidity conditions",
    "Non-toxic to pets and humans",
    "If leaves turn brown, increase humidity and check watering schedule",
    "Can be grown outdoors in USDA zones 9-11 in shaded, humid locations",
    "Fertilize monthly during growing season with diluted balanced fertilizer (quarter strength)"
