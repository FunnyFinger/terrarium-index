  "description": "Alocasia longiloba 'Grandis' is a large form of Alocasia longiloba, a terrestrial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It belongs to the Araceae family and features upright stems (60-120 cm tall) with large, dramatic, arrow-shaped to lance-shaped, dark green leaves with distinctive venation. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Many species have distinctive leaf textures - some are velvety, others have metallic or iridescent surfaces that change color with viewing angle. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive large foliage. It's popular among Alocasia enthusiasts for its impressive size and attractive leaves.",
