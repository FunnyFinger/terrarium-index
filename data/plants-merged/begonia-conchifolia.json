  "description": "Begonia conchifolia var. rubrimacula is a terrestrial plant native to tropical regions of Central America, particularly Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and features upright stems (15-30 cm tall) with small, asymmetrical, shell-shaped (conchifolia means \"shell-leaved\"), dark green leaves with distinctive red spots (rubrimacula means \"red spots\"), perfect for compact spaces. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Leaves often feature striking patterns including spirals, spots, stripes, and iridescent sheens, with some species having translucent \"windows\" in their leaves. Adapted to tropical climates with high humidity, consistent warmth, and filtered light conditions. In its native habitat, it grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant adds natural beauty with its distinctive spotted foliage. It's popular among Begonia enthusiasts for its attractive shell-shaped leaves and red spots.",
