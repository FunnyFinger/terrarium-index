  "description": "Asplenium dimorphum, commonly known as Norfolk Island Spleenwort or Dimorphic Spleenwort, is a fern species endemic to Norfolk Island in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is notable for its distinctive dimorphic fronds: coarse, sterile fronds and finer, lace-like fertile fronds that produce spores. The plant displays an upright, rosette-forming growth habit and typically reaches 15-45 cm in height and spread when grown indoors. In its native habitat, it thrives in the unique ecosystem of Norfolk Island. The hybrid cultivar 'Parvati' (also known as 'Austral Gem'), which is a cross between A. dimorphum and A. difforme, is popular in cultivation for its thick, glossy, leathery fronds and adaptability to indoor environments, typically reaching 30-45 cm. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a stunning architectural focal point with its dimorphic frond structure. It's popular among fern enthusiasts for its unique two-form frond appearance.",
