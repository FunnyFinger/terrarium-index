  "description": "Pinguicula moranensis is a perennial rosette-forming carnivorous plant native to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. It belongs to the Lentibulariaceae family and features summer rosettes of flat, succulent leaves up to 10 cm long, which are covered in mucilaginous (sticky) glands that attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey. Nutrients derived from the prey are used to supplement the nutrient-poor substrate that the plant grows in. In the winter, the plant forms a non-carnivorous rosette of small, fleshy leaves that conserves energy while food and moisture supplies are low. The plant displays a rosette-forming growth habit and typically reaches 8-15 cm in height. Single pink, purple, or violet flowers appear twice a year on upright stalks up to 25 cm long. In its native habitat, it grows in nutrient-poor, wet soils in high-altitude regions. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant offers unique intrigue with its seasonal growth pattern and attractive flowers. It's popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its large size and colorful blooms.",
