  "description": "Rhaphidophora hayi, commonly known as Shingle Plant, is a fascinating climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that press flat against whatever surface it's growing on, resembling green shingles on a roof. The leaves are dark green with prominent veins and have a velvety texture. As the plant matures, the leaves become larger and more pronounced. The plant displays a climbing growth habit and uses aerial roots to attach to surfaces. It's an excellent choice for terrariums where it can climb up backgrounds or walls, creating a unique shingle-like appearance. The plant thrives in high humidity and filtered light.",
