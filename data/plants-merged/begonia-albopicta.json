It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and features upright stems (20-40 cm tall) with small, asymmetrical, dark green leaves with distinctive white spots and markings, perfect for compact spaces. The plant displays an upright, bushy growth habit. Leaves often feature striking patterns including spirals, spots, stripes, and iridescent sheens, with some species having translucent \"windows\" in their leaves.

It's popular among Begonia enthusiasts for its compact size and attractive leaves.",
