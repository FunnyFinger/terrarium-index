  "description": "Aglaonema pumilum is a small, compact aroid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It belongs to the Araceae family and features oval to lance-shaped, dark green leaves (10-20 cm long) with silver or white variegation patterns. The leaves are arranged on short stems. The plant displays an upright, compact growth habit and typically reaches 20-40 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids (spathe and spadix). In its native habitat, it grows as an understory plant in tropical forests. In terrariums or indoor settings, this plant creates a bold, tropical statement with its variegated foliage. It's popular among aroid enthusiasts for its compact size and attractive variegation.",
