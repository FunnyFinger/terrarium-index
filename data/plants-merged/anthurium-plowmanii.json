It belongs to the Araceae family and features large, lance-shaped to oval, dark green leaves (30-60 cm long) with prominent white or silver veins. The leaves have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant displays an upright, compact growth habit and typically reaches 60-120 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers typical of aroids.
